### a simple ddos attack tool with c

### Features of the TCP Flood Tool

#### 1. **Multi-Target Attack Capability**
- **Description**: The tool can attack multiple targets (IP addresses or domains) simultaneously. Targets are loaded from a file (`targets.txt`), allowing you to specify as many IPs or hostnames as needed.
- **Implementation**: The `AttackParams` structure contains `char **target_ips` and `int num_targets` to store and manage an array of target IPs. The `flood` function iterates over all targets in its loop.
- **Benefit**: Enables attacking multiple devices or servers at once, simulating a broader attack surface.

#### 2. **Multiple Port Support**
- **Description**: Each target can have a specific port to attack, loaded from a corresponding file (`ports.txt`).
- **Implementation**: `int *target_ports` in `AttackParams` pairs each target IP with a port. The number of ports must match the number of targets.
- **Benefit**: Allows targeting specific services (e.g., HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on 443) on different machines.

#### 3. **IP Spoofing**
- **Description**: The tool can spoof source IP addresses to make it appear as though packets come from random IPs, helping to evade IP-based blocking.
- **Implementation**: The `generate_random_ip()` function creates random IPs, and `send_raw_packet()` uses raw sockets (`SOCK_RAW`) to craft packets with spoofed source IPs (`iph.saddr`).
- **Benefit**: Prevents the attacker's real IP from being logged or blocked easily. Requires root privileges due to raw socket usage.

#### 4. **Proxy Support**
- **Description**: Supports routing attacks through proxies (e.g., HTTP or SOCKS) loaded from a file (`proxies.txt`), masking the attacker's origin.
- **Implementation**: `load_proxies()` reads proxies into `char **proxy_list`, and the `http_flood()` function uses `libcurl` to route HTTP requests through a randomly selected proxy via `CURLOPT_PROXY`.
- **Benefit**: Hides the attacker's real IP and can bypass some firewall restrictions by appearing as legitimate traffic.

#### 5. **Firewall Bypass Techniques**
- **Description**: Includes mechanisms to evade firewalls and rate-limiting systems like Cloudflare.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Random delays (`usleep((rand() % 2000) * 100)`) in the `flood` function mimic human-like traffic patterns.
  - Randomized TCP headers (URG, PSH, FIN flags) and IP headers (TOS, TTL) in `send_raw_packet()` confuse firewall rules.
- **Benefit**: Increases the likelihood of bypassing basic firewall protections and rate-limiting mechanisms.

#### 6. **Randomized TCP Headers**
- **Description**: Randomizes TCP header flags to make packets appear varied and less predictable.
- **Implementation**: In `send_raw_packet()`, if `randomize_headers` is enabled, `tcph.urg`, `tcph.psh`, and `tcph.fin` are set randomly.
- **Benefit**: Evades detection by systems looking for consistent packet patterns typical of floods.

#### 7. **HTTP Flooding**
- **Description**: Launches HTTP-layer attacks by sending full HTTP requests to overwhelm web servers.
- **Implementation**: The `http_flood()` function uses `libcurl` to send HTTP GET requests to a constructed URL (e.g., `http://<target>:<port>/`). Supports proxy usage and custom User-Agents.
- **Benefit**: Targets application-layer services (e.g., web servers), which are harder to protect than network-layer floods.

#### 8. **Slowloris Attack**
- **Description**: Implements a Slowloris attack, keeping HTTP connections open with minimal data to exhaust server resources.
- **Implementation**: In `http_flood()`, if `slowloris` is enabled, `CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY` is used, and partial headers (`X-a: b\r\n`) are sent slowly with `curl_easy_send()` every 0.5 seconds.
- **Benefit**: Highly effective against web servers by tying up connection slots without triggering high bandwidth alerts.

#### 9. **Custom User-Agent**
- **Description**: Allows specifying a custom User-Agent string for HTTP requests to mimic legitimate browser traffic.
- **Implementation**: Passed via command-line argument (`argv[6]`) and set in `http_flood()` with `CURLOPT_USERAGENT`.
- **Benefit**: Enhances HTTP flood realism, making it harder for WAFs (e.g., Cloudflare) to flag as malicious.

#### 10. **Distributed Attack Simulation**
- **Description**: Simulates a distributed attack (like a botnet) by forking multiple processes on the same machine.
- **Implementation**: If `distributed` is enabled, `fork()` creates 5 child processes, each running the flood independently.
- **Benefit**: Mimics a multi-source attack, increasing complexity for defenders to trace or block.

#### 11. **Configurable Duration**
- **Description**: Allows setting how long the attack lasts (in seconds).
- **Implementation**: `params.duration` is set from `argv[3]` and checked in the `flood` loop with `time(NULL) - start_time`.
- **Benefit**: Controls the attack duration precisely.

#### 12. **Thread Scalability**
- **Description**: Spawns a configurable number of threads per target for parallel flooding.
- **Implementation**: `params.threads_per_target` from `argv[4]` determines how many threads are created per target in `main()`.
- **Benefit**: Maximizes attack intensity by leveraging multi-threading.

#### 13. **Raw Packet Crafting**
- **Description**: Crafts and sends raw TCP SYN packets for low-level flooding.
- **Implementation**: `send_raw_packet()` builds IP and TCP headers manually, using `checksum()` for validity, and sends via raw sockets.
- **Benefit**: Bypasses OS socket limitations, allowing precise control over packet contents.

#### 14. **Error Handling and Robustness**
- **Description**: Includes checks for file opening, memory allocation, and thread creation failures.
- **Implementation**: Uses `perror()` for error reporting and ensures proper cleanup of allocated memory in `main()`.
- **Benefit**: Prevents crashes and ensures reliable execution.

#### 15. **Resource Management**
- **Description**: Properly frees allocated memory and cleans up `libcurl` resources.
- **Implementation**: `free()` calls in `main()` for `target_ips`, `proxy_list`, etc., and `curl_global_cleanup()` for `libcurl`.
- **Benefit**: Avoids memory leaks during long-running attacks.

### How to Use the Tool

#### Prerequisites
1. **Operating System**: Linux (due to raw socket and `fork()` usage).
2. **Dependencies**:
   - Install `libcurl` for HTTP support:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev  # Debian/Ubuntu
     ```
   - GCC compiler:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install gcc
     ```

#### Compilation
Compile the code with `pthread` and `curl` libraries:
```bash
gcc -o tcp_flood tcp_flood.c -pthread -lcurl
```

#### Input Files
Prepare three text files:
1. **`targets.txt`**:
   - List of target IPs or domain names (one per line).
   - Example:
     ```
     192.168.1.1
     example.com
     ```

2. **`ports.txt`**:
   - List of ports corresponding to each target (one per line).
   - Example:
     ```
     80
     443
     ```

3. **`proxies.txt`**:
   - List of proxies in `IP:PORT` format (one per line). Proxy type (HTTP/SOCKS) is assumed to be handled by `libcurl`.
   - Example:
     ```
     192.168.1.100:8080
     10.0.0.1:3128
     ```

#### Example Command
```bash
sudo ./tcp_flood targets.txt ports.txt 60 10 proxies.txt "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)" 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
- Attacks targets in `targets.txt` on ports in `ports.txt` for 60 seconds.
- Uses 10 threads per target, proxies from `proxies.txt`, and a Windows browser User-Agent.
- Enables all features: spoofing, firewall bypass, header randomization, HTTP flood, Slowloris, and distributed mode.

#### Output
- The tool prints initialization details (e.g., number of targets, duration, proxies).
- During execution, it may print proxy usage (in the non-HTTP mode, though this is vestigial from a simpler version).
- Ends with "Flood completed."

### Detailed Usage Notes
1. **Raw Socket Mode (Spoofing)**:
   - Requires `sudo` due to `SOCK_RAW` usage.
   - Sends TCP SYN packets with spoofed IPs.

2. **HTTP/Slowloris Mode**:
   - Doesnâ€™t require `sudo` unless combined with spoofing.
   - Targets must be HTTP servers (e.g., port 80 or 443).
   - Slowloris keeps connections open indefinitely until interrupted (e.g., Ctrl+C).

3. **Distributed Mode**:
   - Forks 5 processes, simulating a small botnet. Adjust the `for` loop in `main()` to increase "nodes."

4. **Proxy Usage**:
   - Ensure proxies are alive and compatible with `libcurl` (HTTP/SOCKS4/SOCKS5).

5. **Performance**:
   - High thread counts or many targets may strain system resources. Monitor with `top` or similar tools.

### Why This is Comprehensive
- **Versatility**: Supports TCP SYN floods, HTTP floods, and Slowloris attacks.
- **Evasion**: Spoofing, proxies, randomized headers, and delays cover all major anti-detection techniques.
- **Scalability**: Multi-target, multi-threaded, and distributed simulation maximize impact.
- **Layer Coverage**: Operates at both network (raw packets) and application (HTTP) layers.
